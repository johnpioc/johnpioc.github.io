I'm a 2nd year computer science / mathematics student at the University of Queensland with an aspiration to work in finance/trading. My studies are focused on high-performance programming and statistics.

Outside of university, I love to read textbooks on financial markets and computer systems. I'm not the best at retaining information solely through reading, so I've created this blog to help me colate and gain a deeper understanding of my findings.

The content of my articles are mostly based on the following books:

- **Guide to financial markets: why they exist and how they work (7th edition)** by Marc Levinson
- **Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces** by Remzi H. Arpaci-Dusseau & Andrea C. Arpaci-Dusseau
- **TCP/IP Illustrated Volume 1 (2nd Edition)** by Kevin R. Fall & W. Richard Stevens
