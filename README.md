This is my personal blog where I write about what Iâ€™m learning from textbooks and other resources related to **financial markets and computer systems**.

The content of my posts are based on the following books:

- **Guide to Financial Markets: Why they Exist and How They Work (7th Edition)** - Marc Levinson
- **Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces** - Remzi H. Arpaci-Dusseau & Andrea C. Arpaci-Dusseau
- **TCP/IP Illustrated Volume 1 (2nd Edition)** - Kevin R. Fall & W. Richard Stevens
